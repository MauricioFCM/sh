# Question Types and Configurations

In the process of creating a survey, users can select from multiple question types, each allowing survey participants to provide their responses in different ways. Here are the question types available:

1. **Single-selection**: Participants choose one option from a list of potential answers.
2. **Multi-selection**: Participants choose multiple options from a list of potential answers.
3. **Slider scale**: Participants respond by positioning a slider along a scale.
4. **Dropdown**: Participants select an answer from a dropdown menu.
5. **Open-ended answer**: Participants provide a free-form text response.
6. **Date & Time**: Participants select a date and/or time.
7. **Ranking**: Participants rank options in order of preference.
8. **Image selection**: Participants select an image from a set of options.

Each of these question types can be configured with various settings, which are as follows:

- **Mark as optional**: This toggle allows the survey creator to mark a question as optional, meaning survey participants are not required to answer it. Available for all question types. By default, this setting is turned off, meaning all questions are required unless otherwise specified.

- **Include 'Other' option**: For single-selection and multi-selection question types, this toggle adds an 'Other' option to the end of the response list, allowing participants to provide a free-text alternative answer. By default, this setting is turned off.

- **Add range**: For the Date & Time question type, this toggle allows the survey creator to add or remove a date and/or time range that participants can select their answer from. By default, this setting is turned off.

- **Image label**: For the Image selection question type, this toggle allows the survey creator to add or remove descriptions for the images. By default, this setting is turned on.

- **Multi-selection**: For the Image selection question type, this toggle enables participants to select multiple images in their response. By default, this setting is turned on.

These configurations offer survey creators the flexibility to design questions that best suit their data collection needs.
