Individual participants' average records per data class can be found in participant management. This includes data such as average step count or average heartrate. You can view the records of a specific participant, or the records of a participant relating to a datapoint of interest.

To view individual results:

1. From any of the **Overview**, **Study Management**, or **Data Insights** pages, look under the Participant Management selection. You can navigate the Participant List to search for specific participants.
2. To check the records of a certain participant, click on their Participant ID.
3. Click on specific points on a graph to view records of the participant associated with that datapoint. For a guide on where to find graphs, refer to [Viewing Graphs](./viewing-graphs.md).
