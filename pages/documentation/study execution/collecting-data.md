Collecting data for the study is straightforward. The connected wearable device monitors and records a participant's health data, and surveys can be sent out at whatever frequency is most convenient. After setting up survey schedules as desired, simply instruct each participant to:

- Wear the watch for the duration of the study.
- Open the app and complete the scheduled survey.
- Participants will also be able to see visualizations of their data through your app.
