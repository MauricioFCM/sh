Once you've completed creating your survey questions, the next step is to schedule and publish the survey. You schedule and publish surveys through the Samsung Health Stack web portal.

To schedule and publish a survey:

1. From the **Create survey** page, click **Publish**.

2. Select the **Frequency** that participants will repeat your study. The options are:

    - One-time - Participants complete this survey type only once.
    - Daily - Participants complete this survey type each day of the study.
    - Weekly - Participants complete this survey type once a week for the duration of the study.
    - Monthly - Participants complete this survey type once a month for the duration of the study.
    > For months with fewer days than the date selected, the survey occurs on the last day of the month
4. For **Publish Time**, select the date and time to start and end when the survey is accessible in the app.
 > **Publish Time** is local time for each participant and must be in the future for all participants.
4. For **Valid Duration**, specify the length of time that each repetition of the survey remains available to participants.
5. Optionally, select **Allow late response after selected duration** to extend **Valid Duration** to the start of the next repetition.
7. Click **Publish**.

> Once published, surveys cannot be modified in Healthcare Research Hub v0.9.
