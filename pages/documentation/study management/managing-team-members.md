# Overview

Each study can have a team of members participating in conducting the study.

These actions are available for managing the study team members:

- [Inviting Team Members and Assigning Roles](#Inviting -team-members-and-assigning-roles)
- [Editing Team Member Information](#editing-team-member-information)
- [Removing a Team Member](#removing-a-team-member)

# Inviting Team Members and Assigning Roles

Invite as many team members to help conduct your study as you desire.

> Only members with the `Project Owner` or `Principal Investigator` [study roles](role-based-access-control.md#study-roles) have the ability to invite members.

To add a member to the team and assign the member a role:

1. From the **Study Settings** page, in the **Members and access** section, click **Invite member**.

2. Enter the email address of the person to invite to the team.

3. Select a study role for the team member. The [role-based access control](role-based-access-control.md) feature provides security with differing levels of access permission granted to different roles:

    - Principal Investigator - has full access to all aspects of the study.
    - Research Assistant - has access to the participant data.
    - Data Scientist - has access to essential features of the data analysis.

    > `Principal Investigator` is the only study role available in the beta version (v0.9) of the portal.

4. Click **Invite Member** to add the person to the study team.

5. Notify the person that you have added them as a team member for the study in the best way for your use case.

> If the person does not already have an account, they receive an account activation email containing instructions to create their account.

When completed, the system adds the selected study role to the person's account settings for the specific study.

> People can have different roles for different studies.
