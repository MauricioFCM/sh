Invite as many team members to help conduct your study as you desire.

> Only members with the `Team Admin` role have permission to invite members.

To invite a member to the team and assign the member a role:

1. From the **Study Settings** page, in the **Members and access** section, click **Invite member**.
    {% include inline_image.html file="inviting-team-members.png" alt="" %}

2. Enter the email address of the person to invite to the team.

3. Select a role for the team member. The role-based access control feature provides security with differing levels of access permission granted to different roles:

    - Principal Investigator - has full control of the study.
    - Research Assistant - has access to the participant data.
    - Data Scientist - has access to essential features of the data analysis.

    > `Principal Investigator` is the only role available in the alpha version (v0.9) of the portal.

4. Click **Invite** to send the prospective new member an invitation email.
