Healthcare Research Hub provides various features to protect data. One of them is RBAC, role-based access control. Let’s see how RBAC is used in practice. For the MG Marker research, as the study operator who is using the portal, let’s invite Dr. McCoy as a Principal Investigator.  
 
By simply going to the “Study Settings” section and clicking on the ‘Invite Member’ button, you could assign Dr. McCoy as the “Principal Investigator” of this study. Accordingly, his data access to this portal are automatically defined based on our RBAC structure ready in place. In similar ways, you could invite other team members and assign them corresponding roles and data access in a breeze. 

With this fine-grained RBAC structure customized for each user’s need, your research study data is in good hands with appropriate level of data permission granted to different roles.
