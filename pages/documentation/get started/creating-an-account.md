All team members involved in studies need a health stack account. You access all backend functionality, whether via the web portal or otherwise, using your health stack account. There are several ways to create an account.

To create your account using the web portal:

1. Refer to  [Launch Web Portal and Create Account](../installation/installing-the-portal.md#iii-launch-web-portal-and-create-account) in the web portal installation instructions.

To create your account from the command line:

1. Refer to  [Create Initial Account](../installation/installing-the-backend.md#xiii-create-initial-account) in the backend system installation instructions.

To invite a team member to create their account (as part of joining a study) using the web portal:

1. Refer to [Inviting Team Members and Assigning Roles](../study management/managing-team-members.md#inviting-team-members-and-assigning-roles).

To use code to invite a team member to create their account (as part of joining a study):

1. Refer to `/account-service/invitations` in [Account Service API Endpoints](../../api reference/account-services.md).
