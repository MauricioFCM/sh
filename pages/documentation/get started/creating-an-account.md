# Full-Stack Implementations
All team members involved in studies need a health stack account. You access all backend functionality, whether via the web portal or otherwise, using your health stack account.

## Web Portal
To create your account directly, separate from any study:

1. Refer to [Launch Web Portal and Create Account](../installation/installing-the-portal.md#iii-launch-web-portal-and-create-account) in the web portal installation instructions.

To invite a team member to create their account (as part of joining a study):

1. Refer to [Inviting Members and Assigning Roles](../study management/managing-team-members.md#inviting-team-members-and-assigning-roles).

## Comand Line Interface
To create your account  directly, separate from any study:

1. Refer to [Create Initial Account](../installation/installing-the-backend.md#xiii-create-initial-account) in the backend system installation instructions.

To invite a  team member to create their account (as part of joining a study):

1. Refer to `/account-service/invitations` in [Account Service API Endpoints](../../api reference/account-services.md).

# SDK-Only Implementations
Because Samsung Health Stack accounts are part of the backend system, creating an account does not apply to SDK-Only implementations.
