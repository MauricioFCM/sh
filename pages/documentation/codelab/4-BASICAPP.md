# What you will do

To perform research, researchers must have method to interact with participants.
Mobile applications on a smartphone is a good option for that, especially the case utilizing wearables.

From this step, we will present very simple method to build an app for participant using Healthcare Research SDK.

# Preliminaries

Currently, Research SDK covers only for Androids (and WearOS).
You'd be better to familiar with Android Studios.

# Make a `MG Marker` research app

## Downloading sample sources

Research Hub provides sample android application sources using Research SDK.

You can get sample codes with following steps.

## Customizing sample apps

Some modifications needed to perform our research.

### Change research introductions, consents and eligibility questions

To participate `MG Marker` research a person must agree with some conditions and meet the conditions.

Let's deliver information to them

..coding instructions..

### Connect with back-ends

To integrate back-ends, a couple of codes should be added.

..coding instructions..

## Let's build the app

Now, click run button on Android Studio.

If you have done correctly, you could see the app running like this.
