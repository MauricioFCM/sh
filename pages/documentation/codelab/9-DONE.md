# Congratulations

You have successfully finished this Code Lab, demonstrating basic features of Healthcare Research Hub.

You can extend apps to fit your researches and even modify SDK, platform, portal sources, if you can.

# Next step

To perform actual research, you must secure ways to distribute your mobile app to participants.

You can just deliver `.apk` file to participants and let them install, or provide download link,
or register the app to Play store for participants' conveniences.
