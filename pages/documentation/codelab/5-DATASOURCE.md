# What you will do

Wearable devices connected with smartphone can be used a source of data in which many researches are interested.
From this step, we present a very simple, neat way of connecting mobile app with these data sources using Research SDK.

# Android Health Connect

.. Short introduction of Health Connect ..

.. And links for relevant information ..

# Data Source adaptor configuration

For `MG Marker` research, we must collect heart rate, activity data of participants.

To do that, we just simply put spec for data collection in app source.

.. code descriptions ..

Then, heart rate, blah blah would be delivered into back-ends.
