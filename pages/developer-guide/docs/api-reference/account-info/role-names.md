Our stack allows users to assign user roles using the API endpoints in the  [Account Service  API Endpoints](account-service-api-endpoints.html).

V1.0 expanded roles from two to four. Following are the respective key values for these roles: 

| **Role**               | **REST API Key**         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Study Creator          | “study-creator”          |
| Principal Investigator | “principal-investigator” |
| Research Assistant     | “research-assistant”     |
| Data Scientist         | “data-scientist”         |
