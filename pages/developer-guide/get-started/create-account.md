# Full-Stack Implementations
Members are the people who are conducting the study. All team members involved in studies need a health stack account. You access all backend functionality, whether via the web portal or otherwise, using your health stack account.

## Web Portal
To create your account directly, separate from any study:

1. Refer to [Launch Web Portal and Create Account](../installation/install-portal.md#iii-launch-web-portal-and-create-account) in the web portal installation instructions.

To invite a team member to create their account (as part of joining a study):

1. Refer to [Inviting Members and Assigning Roles](../study-management/managing-team-members.md#inviting-team-members-and-assigning-roles) in the web portal user guide.

## API Endpoints
To create your account  directly, separate from any study:

1. Refer to [Create Initial Account](../installation/install-backend.md#xv-create-initial-account) in the backend system installation instructions.

To invite a team member to create their account (as part of joining a study):

1. Refer to `/account-service/invitations` in [Account Service API Endpoints](../../api-reference/account-service-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference.

# SDK-Only Implementations
Because health stack accounts are part of the health stack's backend system and do not interface with the participant app, creating health stack accounts does not apply to SDK-only implementations.
